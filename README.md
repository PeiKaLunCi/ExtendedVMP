# ExtendedVMP
This repository contains the experiments presented in the paper "Extended Variational Message Passing (EVMP) for Automated Approximate Bayesian Inference". The EVMP method is developed for [ForneyLab.jl](https://github.com/biaslab/ForneyLab.jl), a message passing based probabilistic programming package implemented in Julia language.
